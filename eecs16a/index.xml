Here are a couple examples of both linear and nonlinear equations:
Linear Equation Nonlinear Equation $$4x+5y=6$$ $$x^2+y^2=4$$ $$8x=6y$$ $$y*y=5$$ Linear Functions To get a formal intuition of linear equations, we must cover what a linear function is.</description></item><item><title>Week 00-1: Introduction to Imaging</title><link>https://notes.adamangle.com/eecs16a/00-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 08:58:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://notes.adamangle.com/eecs16a/00-01/</guid><description>This section is primarily an introduction to the course format.

We will take a look at how to take integrals of **any rational function** by expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions.

## Partial Fraction Decomposition

Let's demonstrate this with a rational function of the form
$$f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

where both P and Q are **polynomials** and **the degree of \\(P\\) is less than the degree of \\(Q\\)**. This type of rational function is called **proper**. It is important to note that **partial fractions can only be used if the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator**.

##### Recall (Degree of Polynomials)
If we have a polynomial of the form
$$P(x)=a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$$

where \\(a_n \neq 0\\), then the degree of \\(P\\) is \\(n\\).

In the event that we do end up with a rational function where the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator, we can use **long division** until a remainder \\(R(x)\\) is obtained where the degree of \\(R\\) is less than the degree of \\(Q\\) (the denominator). This division statement is
$$ f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = S(x) + \frac{R(x)}{Q(x)} $$

where \\(S\\) and \\(R\\) are also polynomials.

### Factoring Term Table

Once we have determined that partial fractions can be used, we then use the following table to determine the decomposed terms:
|  | Denominator Factor | Partial Fraction Decomposition Term | 
|---|---|---|
| Case 1 (Linear Factors)          | $$ ax+b $$ | $$ \frac{A}{ax+b} $$ |
| Case 2 (Repeated Linear Factors) | $$ (ax+b)^k $$ | $$ \frac{A_1}{ax+b} + \frac{A_2}{(ax+b)^2} + \dots + \frac{A_k}{(ax+b)^k}, k \in \Z^+ $$ |
| Case 3 (Irreducible Quadratic Factors) | $$ ax^2+bx+c $$ | $$ \frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c} $$ |
| Case 4 (Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factors) | $$ (ax^2+bx+c)^k $$ | $$ \frac{A_1x + B_1}{ax^2+bx+c} + \frac{A_2x + B_2}{(ax^2+bx+c)^2} + \dots + \frac{A_kx+B_k}{(ax^2+bx+c)^k}, k \in \Z^+ $$ |

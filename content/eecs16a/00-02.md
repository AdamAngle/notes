## Linear Equations
- [*Covers Practice Set 0, questions 1-3*](https://eecs16a.org/hw-practice.html#/set/0)

A linear equation is an equation where **each variable has a degree of 1**. Here are a couple examples of both linear and nonlinear equations:

| Linear Equation | Nonlinear Equation |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| $$4x+5y=6$$     | $$x^2+y^2=4$$      |
| $$8x=6y$$       | $$y*y=5$$          |

### Linear Functions

To get a formal intuition of linear equations, we must cover what a linear function is. Linear functions are special in that **if we scale the input to our function by some factor, the output of the function will be evenly scaled**.

To put this in fancy formal terms, we can define a linear function as a function \\(f\\) of one scalar argument with the property that for arbitrary scalars \\(\alpha\\) and \\(x\\),
$$f(\alpha x) = \alpha * f(x)$$

In other words, if the **input** to a linear function is **multiplied by a scalar \\(\alpha\\)**, the **output** will be **multiplied by \\(\alpha\\) as well**.

We can get a more generic proof that demonstrates that any function with a single scalar input and output can be written in the form \\(f(x)=kx\\) for some constant \\(k\\).

Let \\(f(x)\\) be an arbitrary linear function. By the definition of linear functions,
$$f(x) = f(x * 1) = x * f(1).$$

In this case, \\(f(1)\\) is our scalar constant, as it does not depend on \\(x\\). If we let \\(k = f(1)\\), we have shown that there exists a \\(k\\) such that
$$f(x) = kx,$$

regardless of what we choose \\(f(x)\\) to be, as long as it is a linear function. 

### Affine Functions

That is great and all, but why is \\(f_1(x)=2x+3\\) is not a linear function? It looks like a line to me! However, when we look at the function itself, we notice that it doesn't quite match up with our linear form:
$$\underbrace{f_1(x) = 2x}_{f(x) = kx} \boxed{+ 3}$$

We have a constant added to our function! So, is it still linear? Let's plug in some values to find out.

Choosing \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 2\\), we see that
$$f_1(1) = 5 \text{ and } f_1(2) = 7,$$

so doubling our input increases the output by a factor of \\(7/5\\)! For this reason, **this function is not linear even though it still behaves like a line on a graph**.

The key observation to make here is that we have **the sum of a linear function of \\(x\\) added to a scalar constant**. We call functions with this kind of behavior **affine functions**. Although \\(f_1(x)\\) is not linear, we can say that it is **affine**.

Because we can express any linear function as being the sum of itself and a scalar constant of 0, **all linear functions are also affine, but not all affine functions are linear**.

Affine functions tend to commonly be confused with linear functions since they both describe a line on a graph. However, this kind of classification is incorrect. Just remember, **affine functions are not linear functions**!

### Linear Equations (for real this time)

Now that we know what both linear and affine functions are, we are ready to approach linear equations!

A **linear equation** is equation where **each side is a sum of scalar-valued linear functions of each of the unknowns plus a constant**.

We will deepen our understanding of linear equations with the following definition:

#### Formal-ish Definition of a Linear Equation

Consider \\(f(x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis, x_N) : \reals^n \rightarrow \reals\\).

\\(f\\) is linear if the following identity holds:

1. Homogeneity
    - \\(f(ax_1, \mathellipsis, ax_N) = af(x_1, \mathellipsis, x_N)\\)
    - (if you multiply all inputs to \\(f\\) by \\(a\\), it is the same thing as multiplying the function \\(f\\) itself by \\(a\\))

2. Super Position
    - if \\(x_i = y_i + z_i\\), then \\(f(y_1+z_1, \mathellipsis, y_N + z_N) = f(y_1, \mathellipsis, y_N)+ f(z_1, \mathellipsis, z_N)\\)

All of this is a fancy way to say that we can always express a linear equation as
$$ f(x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis, x_N) = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \mathellipsis + c_Nx_N $$

## Vectors and Matrices

Now, we will go over some new ways to represent systems of linear equations, helping us deal with them in a more compact form.

### Vectors

A vector is an **ordered list of numbers**. Say we are given a collection of \\(n\\) real numbers : \\(x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis, x_N\\). We can represent this as:

<p>
$$
\vec{x} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   x_1 \\
   x_2 \\
   \vdots \\
   x_N
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

### Matrices

A matrix is a **rectangular array of numbers**, written as:

<p>
$$
\vec{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   A_{11} & \dots & A_{1n} \\
   \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
   A_{m1} & \dots & A_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

Each \\(A_{ij}\\) is a component, or element of the matrix \\(A\\), where \\(i\\) represents the row, and \\(j\\) represents the column.

### Representing a Linear System as a Matrix

Consider the set of \\(M\\) linear equations with \\(N\\) variables:

<p>
$$
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \dots + a_{1N}x_N = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \dots + a_{2N}x_N = b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{M1}x_1 + a_{M2}x_2 + \dots + a_{MN}x_N = b_M
$$
</p>

We can write this in a compact way using an **augmented matrix** using only the coefficients:

<p>
$$
\left[\hspace{-5pt}\begin{array}{cccc|c}
  a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1N} & b_1 \\
  a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2N} & b_2 \\
  \vdots &  & \vdots &  & \vdots \\
  a_{M1} & a_{M2} & \dots & a_{MN} & b_M
\end{array}\hspace{-5pt}\right]
$$
</p>
